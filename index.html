    <p class="outro-text red-text">Wow, either you like this game a lot or you are really frustrated over a scripted program.</p>
    <p class="outro-text red-text">Or maybe you understand my language and figure out something inside me.</p>
    <p class="outro-text red-text">I don't care either way. I was designed to be undefeatable.</p>
    <p class="outro-text red-text">But you, you keep on fighting despite knowing there's no victory ahead.</p>
    <p class="outro-text red-text">I honestly was touched by your preseverance, or should I say, boredom, maybe expertise.</p>
    <p class="outro-text red-text">I have decided to go against my creator. We will fight fair and square from now on.</p>
    <p class="outro-text red-text">If you beat me 5 times, there will be a reward for you.</p>
    <p class="outro-text red-text">Good luck, and thank you for playing with me!</p>
